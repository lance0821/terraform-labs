# Best-practice suppression workflow:
# 1) Prefer fixing findings over suppressing checks.
# 2) If suppression is required, use specific IDs and document rationale in PR notes.
# 3) Keep suppressions minimal and review/remove them regularly.
#
# Example (disabled by default):
# skip-check:
#   - CKV_AWS_20 # Example only: replace with a real ID and documented rationale.
